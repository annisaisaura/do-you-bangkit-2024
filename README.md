# Do-You Application Repository

This repository serves as documentation for the development of the Do-You mobile application using the **Kotlin programming language**, based on **machine learning** and **cloud computing**. The Do-You application is developed by the **C241-PS530** team from **Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 1**, with its main features being career recommendations and course recommendations.

We document the frontend development on the `md` branch, machine learning models for feature needs on the `ml` branch, and endpoints for the application on the `cc`, `cc-copy`, and `cc-dual` branches (`cc-copy` as the current main branch for CC).

Here's the documentation of our application's flowchart and UI.
